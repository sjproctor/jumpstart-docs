# Mini Jumpstart

A 6 hour intro to coding course featuring the fundamentals of the languages of the web: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  Students will build out a Magic 8 Ball game that allows the user to ask a question and predicts the `*`future. Students will create the basic HTML code that will allow the game to be seen in a browser, then add the game interaction with JavaScript code. After the game functionality, students will create an appealing user experience with CSS including a custom-made Magic 8 Ball.

`*` The accuracy of Magic 8 Ball's predictions may vary.
