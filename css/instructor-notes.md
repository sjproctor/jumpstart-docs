# CSS Instructor Notes

- id/class
- syntax
- flex box
- animation/keyframes
- boarder around elements to see where the div is


### Centering
- margin: 0 auto; As long at the element has a defined width, this will center it - wrap the image in a div and apply margin: 0 auto
- width: max-content; fits the width of your element based on the exact width of the content inside of it, good for responsive design or text content that will change
- transitions: ease-in-out .2s; good for hover animations, use on the original element not the :hover element for a mouse hover effect
